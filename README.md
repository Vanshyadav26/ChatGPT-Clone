# ChatGPT-Clone

🧠 ChatGPT Clone – Flask + MongoDB
This project is a lightweight ChatGPT-style conversational web app built with Flask (Python), a simple HTML/Tailwind frontend, and MongoDB for storing chat history. It uses the OpenAI Chat Completion API to generate responses.

🚀 Features
Chat interface powered by OpenAI's GPT model

Message persistence using MongoDB (chat history stored per session)

Clean UI built with Tailwind CSS

Session-based conversation tracking using UUID

Flask backend with REST API

Easily extensible for authentication, multiple users, or UI enhancements

🗂 Tech Stack
Backend: Flask, Python, OpenAI API, PyMongo

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

Database: MongoDB (local or cloud via MongoDB Atlas)

⚙️ How It Works
A user sends a message via the frontend form.

The backend appends this message to the current session history.

This history is sent to OpenAI’s API using gpt-3.5-turbo (or any chosen model).

The response from the assistant is saved in MongoDB and returned to the frontend.

Both the user and assistant messages are displayed on the screen.
